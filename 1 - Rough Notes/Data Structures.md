# Data Structures

>- DS is information stored in a format!
>- eg. array
>- sorted array is an even better DS than regular array
>- in sorted DS, binary search is superior in typical scenarios
>- DS stores data in the memory in a way that each subsequent operation(query/update) is fast and a DS-invariant is maintained
>- sorting and DS are used heavily in all applications
>- example:

>- idea (2):
>	- Range-min-matrix(i,j): Store range min in the (i,j)<sup>th</sup> entry of a matrix(This is basically creating a lookup table which is in most cases a one time investment if we are storing the lookup matrix and can reference in the future)
>	- time and HDD space~=$n^2$(worse than before)
