# Easyeffects

- Has all kinds of audio manipulation options including equalizer to enhance pipewire audio in arch linux
- Can simply install it from flatpak and go bonkers on the audio customization to suit our liking
- The currently saved presets are for my JBL Quantum 910 
- I personally use it on 71% volume (mildly blasting my ears into oblivion because it's fun)
