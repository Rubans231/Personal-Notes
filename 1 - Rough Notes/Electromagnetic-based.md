# Electromagnetic-based

>- Frequencies from 10Hz to 2.4GHz band

>- These Electromagnetic(EM) waves carry info generated by both  electric and magnetic components across the space without the need for any transport medium and can be interpreted by smartphone sensors
>- The lower the frequency the larger the wavelength(The further the signal can travel and easier it can pass through obstacles hence why frequency modulation, cellular transmitters, etc.. are of low frequencies)
>- To compensate for the lack of distance in the large frequencies, they offer higher bandwidth capacity to serve many users simultaneously, which explains why WiFi, Bluetooth are in this category
>- EM signals can carry position related info(example: MAC address, wireless channel, Geo-coded data, etc..) that the receiving smartphone may infer to determine its location

## WiFi

>- Communicate wireless via an access point(AP) on the 2.4GHz band or the newer 5GHz band
>- on smartphones, WiFi was intended to allow the user to connect to nearby hotspots or routers for internet access. The recent "WiFi Direct protocol" allows two smartphones to exchange data directly with no AP
>- On smartphone, the visible info is only name, MAC address and the received signal strength(RSS) of nearby APs. To obtain this info, the phone initiates a scan, which listens on each on the 14 channel on the 2.4GHz band for a short time  for any data sent by periodically nearby APs. This is passive scanning
>- Default, WiFi APs broadcast data simultaneously on all channels every 100 ms. Thus phones take 1.5 s to scan
>- PC and laptop are faster by flooding probe request frames on all WiFi channels and waits for probe response from the APs. This completes within 200-500 ms which is faster. This is active scanning. Active scanning is not on androids due to preserving battery and reduce overloading WiFi channels
>- Therefore, the challenges for WiFi RSS-based system are:

- _Indoor areas with similar RSS_. Since the APs were primarily designed with data communication in mind, their deployed positions may not be optimal for indoor positioning.
    
- _Changing indoor interior_. Any rearrangement of furniture may alter the way the WiFi signals are deflective, absorbed, and scattered around the building.
    
- _The missing APs_. As these systems rely heavily on the WiFi APs, an AP taken off-line may impact the positioning result, or worse, requiring a new survey of the building.
    
- _The scanning delay_. As discussed above, passive scanning on Android devices may take up to 1.5 s, which may not be suitable for monitoring fast moving users.
    
- _WiFi cell breathing_. This mechanism is implemented in most new WiFi network to permit overloaded APs with too many connected users to offload their work to neighborhood APs. The consequence is that the coverage zone, and APs RSS, which are critical for a positioning system, dynamically change depending on the number of active users.

- _extra_: It is worth noting that there are other types of WiFi-based distance measure, most notably is the Channel State Information (CSI), which addresses the major WiFi multi-path challenge by providing rich, fine-grained information of the channel response, obtained from the PHY layer (whereas traditional RSS is obtained from the MAC layer which does not separate any multi-path characteristics). However, the CSI measure is not exposed by the official Android OS, and requires proprietary hardware (e.g. Intel 5300 NIC) and custom software

- Overall, despite its challenges, WiFi is still perhaps one of the most popular choices for indoor positioning right now, due to its ubiquity.

## Bluetooth



## Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)




## Cellular

>- Cellular technology allows mobile devices to call, text each other, as well as accessing the Internet via the mobile network provider. 
>- At the heart of this technology is the cell tower, which serves a specific geographical area (i.e. cell). When the users move between cells, their information are automatically handed over among towers. 
>- To avoid signal interference, adjacent cells use different signal frequencies.

From the smartphones' perspective, the available information are the cell ID, the signal strength, and the signal-to-noise ratio of nearby cell towers. Most notably, there are multiple large crowd-sourced cell tower databases, which contain the geographical location of most towers, to be used for trilateration of the mobile devices.

>Nevertheless, cellular-based indoor positioning faces the following challenges.

- _Highly coarse positioning_. It is common for cell towers to be placed 2 to 3 km apart, making it challenging to distinguish the user location within a cell.
    
- _Weak signal_. Although cellular signals operate on lower frequencies than GNSS, allowing it to penetrate most building materials to which the satellite signals struggle, well-shielded buildings with thick walls, glasses may still block out the cellular signals.
    

>Overall, due to its low spatial signal difference, cellular technology may only offer city/town level positioning accuracy.
