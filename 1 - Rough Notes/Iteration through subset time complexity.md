# Iteration through subset time complexity


The reason iterating through **all subsets of an array** has a time complexity of O($2^n$) is due to the **number of subsets** that exist for a set of n elements.

---

### üî¢ Why 2n2^n subsets?

For a set (or array) with n elements:

- Each element has **2 choices**: either it's **included** in a subset or it's **not included**.
    
- So for n elements, the total number of possible subsets is:
    
    2√ó2√ó‚ãØ√ó2=$2^n$
    
    (multiplied n times)
    

---

### üßÆ Example

If you have an array like:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

- The subsets are:
    
    ```
    [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]
    ```
    
- That's 8 subsets ‚Üí 23=82^3 = 8

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

If your algorithm **visits each subset** (e.g., to generate them, sum them, or check something), then:

- You must do **something for each of the $2^n$ subsets.
    
- So the time complexity is **O(2n)O(2^n)** in the worst case.
    

This isn't because looping itself takes 2n2^n time ‚Äî it's because **you have to loop through 2n2^n items** (the subsets), and that's just how many there are.
