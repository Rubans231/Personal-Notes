# LLMs(Large language models)

>- it is a subset of NLP models characterized by size, training data and ability to perform a wide range of language tasks with minimal specific training
>- examples:
>	- Llama
>	- GPT
>	- Claude

## Characteristics

>- **Scale**: Millions to hundreds of billions of parameters
>- **General capabilities**: Perform multiple tasks without task specific training
>- **In-context learning**: Learn from examples in prompt
>- **Emergent abilities**: Demonstrate unexpected capabilities as models grow

## Limitations
>- **Hallucinations**: Generate incorrect info confidently
>- **Lack of true understanding**: Operate based on statistical patterns, not true comprehension
>- **Bias**
>- **Context windows**: Limited context, though improving
>- **Computational resources**: Require significant resources
