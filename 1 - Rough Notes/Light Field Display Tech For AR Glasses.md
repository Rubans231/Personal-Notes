# Light Field Display Tech For AR Glasses

>- A technology that reconstructs the light rays from a 3D scene, allowing viewers to see realistic 3D images without special glasses
>- Natural vision in Augmented reality
>- Seamless blending of the real and virtual
>-  Visual conflicts, eye-strain and nausea elimination
>-  Comfortable prolonged use
>- prescription fit for corrected vision (integration with prescription lenses)

## Working:

>- Image gets projected from the stem of the glasses to the lens and gets projected back to the eyes(Projected back through the holographic lens which is mounted in front of the regular lenses)

>- The images are actually a combination of 30 different projections which our eyes are able to correct and view as a single image
>- each of the different projection shows the same scene in a slightly different perspective and when our eyes can combine these to view the image in real depth
>- These are refracted by the eye's retina focal length and contractions to view depth in the way we like by focusing on different objects
>- This is possible through a MEMS mirror which is a little electronically controlled mirror which can rapidly change it's orientation
>- the projector can input up-to 8000 images per second which the MEMS mirror rapidly directs to the different pinholes to trick brain into thinking it is looking at a final video which is of 240 frames per second 
>
## Limitations
>- This is done by CREAL and is kinda very limited on the fact that custom chips for such a small device take millions of dollars to produce and the current holographic lens sticker being very fragile. Also custom fitting is hard.
## Uses

>- This tech is mainly focused to by used in the field of surgeons and military
