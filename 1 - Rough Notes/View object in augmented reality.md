# View object in augmented reality

>- capture images of a physical environment surrounding the device using image capture system
>- construct a map of the physical environment while simultaneously tracking and updating a location and pose of the device in the physical environment using the images captured by the image capture system and input from an inertial measurement unit in the device(Indoor positioning system)
>- register one or more markers indicating a physical location of an object fixed in the physical environment
>- display a visual graphical representation of the virtual object in the virtual marker
>- operating a physics utility in the memory to apply laws of physics to define an interaction between the virtual object and the real object

# Indoor Positioning System

>- [[smartphone sensors useful for indoor positioning]]
